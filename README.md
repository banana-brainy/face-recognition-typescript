# My project: "Face Recognition App" on Typescript

I am coding along the ZTM course, making a face recognition app, but instead of Javascript, I am using Typescript.

So far, so good, but right now I have some struggles. I can't figure them out by myself, so it's time to ask some friends at Stackoverflow.
